## ⚡️ Build to be fast
Whether you use Cupid over-the-air or bundle it locally, Cupid is built to be lightning fast, with or without added minimisations.

In a world where there are so many different screen choices, Cupid is made to load and scale properly to give you piece of mind when using it in production.

## ♿ Accessible by default
When using our NPM packages or templates, you're staying accessible to the massses with high contrast, keyboard-navigatable layouts, and WCAG compliancy."

Tweak any part of your layouts or build your own based off the existing classes to make powerful layouts out-of-the-box.

## 🖌️ Theming made simple
Whether you use media queries or have a toggle, dark and light themes are both easy to control and configure through basic CSS variables.
