## HTML Layout
```html
<p class="alert success"><strong>Woah!</strong> You did something not good, but great!</p>
<p class="alert warning"><strong>Careful, buster.</strong> No misbheaving!</p>
<p class="alert error"><strong>Uh oh!</strong> George has broken something again.</p>
<p class="alert info">I just wanted to say you look really cool.</p>
```

**Supported statuses:** Success, warning, error, info.

## React Layout
```tsx
import { Alert } from '@cupid-ui/react';

// [...]

<Alert
  title="Woah!"
  text="You did something not good, but great!"
  type="success"
/>
```

### Parameters
- `title` (optional): Must be a `string`. This goes before the rest of the text and is in bold. Solid for a quick detail, followed by more elaborate information about the alert.
- `text`: Must be a `string`. This is what the alert says.
- `type`: Can be `"success" | "warning" | "error" | "info"`. Sets the type of button you want.
- Children elements: Although not technically passed, you can specify child elements to the `<Alert></Alert>`. This allows for ease when using Cupid with tools like MDX. This is an alternative to the `text` parameter.
