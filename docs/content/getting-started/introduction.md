## Quick Start

Setting up Cupid is both simple and quick. [Quick Start →](/docs/getting-started/quick-start/)

## Usage recommendations
### Fonts
We recommend using the [Inter](https://rsms.me/inter) fontface by [Rasmus Andersson](https://rsms.me). We use this font while creating every component, but left it unpackaged to make our library much smaller. You can either link to it (`<link rel="stylesheet" media="all" href="https://rsms.me/inter/inter.css" type="text/css">`) or use the [`inter-ui` package on npm.](https://www.npmjs.com/package/inter-ui). If Inter is too large for your solution, we recommend just using the default fonts on the user's device, as these usually still look great.

### Colours
The colours we use are [WCAG AAA compliant](https://webaim.org/articles/contrast/), to help us follow through on one of the three pillars for this framework: accessibility. When using classes to have your own colour scheme, please try to maintain this same contrast to allow people to use your site to the fullest.
